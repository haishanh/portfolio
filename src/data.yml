    - Provide an example for forking a repository on GitHub.
    - Creating a fork is producing a personal copy of someone else's project.
    - Forks act as a sort of bridge between the original repository and your personal copy.
    - You can submit Pull Requests to help make other people's projects better by offering your changes up to the original project.
    - Forking is at the core of social coding at GitHub.
